# Binomial Distribution 

###### What is a Binomial Distribution?

A **binomial distribution** can be thought of as simply the probability of a SUCCESS or FAILURE outcome in an experiment or survey that is repeated multiple times. The binomial is a type of distribution that has **two possible outcomes** (the prefix “[bi](http://membean.com/wrotds/bi-twice)” means two, or twice). For example, a coin toss has only two possible 
outcomes: heads or tails and taking a test could have two possible outcomes: pass or fail.

###### What are the 4 requirements needed to be a binomial distribution?

- The number of observations n is fixed.
- Each observation is independent.
- Each observation represents one of two outcomes ("success" or "failure").
- The **probability** of "success" p is the same **for** each outcome.
