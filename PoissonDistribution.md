# Poisson Distribution

##### What is Poisson distribution in statistics?

In **statistics**, a **Poisson distribution** is a **statistical distribution** that shows how many times an event is likely to occur within a specified period of time. It is used for independent events which occur at a constant rate within a given interval of time.

The **Poisson distribution** is a probability **distribution**. It is named after Sim√©on Denis **Poisson** who discovered it in 1838. It measures the probability that a certain number of events occur within a certain period of time. The events need to be unrelated to each other. They also need to occur with a known 
average rate.

### Examples that violate the Poisson assumptions

- The number of students who arrive at the [student union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_center)  per minute will likely not follow a Poisson distribution, because the  rate is not constant (low rate during class time, high rate between  class times) and the arrivals of individual students are not independent  (students tend to come in groups). 
- The number of magnitude 5 earthquakes per year in a country may  not follow a Poisson distribution if one large earthquake increases the  probability of aftershocks of similar magnitude. 
- Among patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital,  the number of days that the patients spend in the ICU is not Poisson  distributed because the number of days cannot be zero. The distribution  may be modeled using a [Zero-truncated Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-truncated_Poisson_distribution). 
- Count distributions in which the number of intervals with zero  events is higher than predicted by a Poisson model may be modeled using a  [Zero-inflated model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-inflated_model).
